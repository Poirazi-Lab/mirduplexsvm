# MiRduplexSVM instructions

## Train - Test MiRduplexSVM
1. Download miRBase data (`miRNA.dat`) from [mirbase.org/ftp.shtml](http://www.mirbase.org/ftp.shtml). We have test the code on versions 17 (included in the download) and 19.
2. Put the `.dat` file to `MiRduplexSVM/code/input/data` folder
3. Go in folder `MiRduplexSVM/code`, and run script `init.m`. The performed steps are printed in matlab's command window. Note: 
  - The fold of the cross validation are set in the second cell. 
  - Only human and mouse hairpins are selected to train â€“ test the algorithm. You can change this in cell 6, line 76. 
4. Run script `runexpCrossVal.m` to optimize hyper parameters employing 5 fold cross validation.
  - In the first cell, the user can set SVMs hyperparameters. Only the polynomial kernel can be used. The default parameters are the ones used in the MiRduplexSVM publication [Karathanasis et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126151)
  - Second cell trains the SVMs
  - In the third cell the user should re-set SVMs hyperparameters. 
  - The forth cell tests the models which were produced from the second cell.
  - The fifth cell generate figures with several metrics to evaluate performance.
5. Run script `runexpHoldOut.m` to train and test the final model using a hold out set. 
  - In the second cell the user should provide the desired parameters. The default parameters are the ones used in the MiRduplexSVM publication [Karathanasis et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126151)
  - The last cell generate figures with several metrics to evaluate performance.
       
## Results
The .mat file with the actual numbers of the performance metrics can be found in the `MiRduplexSVM/code/Results` folder. 

The cumulative distributions of the errors can be found by following the steps below:
    - Load a `_CumFreq_10.mat` file
    - Duplex errors, (similar to figure 3), are included in the `meanAbsErrorMeanCumRelFreq` double. 
    - k55, k53, k35, k33 errors (similar to figure 4) are included in the `f5p5pMeanAbsErrorCumRelFreq`, `f5p3pMeanAbsErrorCumRelFreq`, `f3p5pMeanAbsErrorCumRelFreq`, `f3p3pMeanAbsErrorCumRelFreq` doubles, respectively.


### Thank you for using MiRduplexSVM!
